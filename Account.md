Now that you're [logged in](Authentication.md#logging-in), you'll probably want to get to know yourself a little bit. Here we go...

Most account API calls require an `account_id` so the service knows which of your accounts to act on. You'll need to [gather the list of accounts](#gather-list-of-accounts) to get their `account_id`.

# Gather List of Accounts

I don't know if Robinhood will allow multiple accounts per user in the future, but this endpoint returns a paginated list of accounts so... maybe. I'd love to have access to both a cash and Instant (margin) account.

**Method**

| URI                         | HTTP Method | Authentication |
|-----------------------------|-------------|----------------|

**Fields**

AFAIK, there are none.

**Request sample**
